Here is another react project Passeord Generator. In this project I have used react hooks namely useState, useEffect, useCallback and useRef. 

useState hook helped me to manage state of length of password. I also helped to store boolean values of number and character button.

useEffect hook helped to change password when any change occurred in number, character and lengh of password.

useRef used to refer a password generated texbox. Using this hook the selected or copied text effect added to input textbox.

useCallback hook used to optimize the code. According to depedecies provided to this hook is stores that depedecies in cache memory.
